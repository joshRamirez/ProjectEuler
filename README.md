My solutions to Project Euler Problems found on https://projecteuler.net/

common package contains Util which has functions that do a specific generic task like getting a list of primes or checking if a string is a palindrome.
The classes located in the kotlin directory handle most of the problem specific code.

Tests have been set up to test both the Util and problems' code. Not extensively checking for edge cases, mainly checking for correct solution to the problem!
